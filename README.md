This is a simple self hosted project to tweet out your Letterboxd diary entries.

The project reads Letterboxd's RSS feed using [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser) to find new diary entries for a givern user, and posts them to Twitter using the [official atproto python package](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto).

## Deployment
The project can be run locally, but was designed to be run on Docker.

The image is hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/finiteui/letterboxd-bluesky-poster) and can be deployed from there.
To deploy the project on docker:
- Create a new directory and download the included [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file into it.
- In the directory, create a file named .env with the contents defined below.
- In the terminal, navigate to this directory, and run ```docker compose up -d```

If the Letterboxd-Tweeter.env file variables are correct, you should be up and running.

## ENV File
This project relies on an env file named .env with configuration variables to run. An example can be found [here](.env.example).
The file needs the following:
```
LETTERBOXD_ACCOUNT = Your Letterboxd account name
BLUESKY_USERNAME = Your full BlueSky user name (no @)
BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD = A valid BlueSky app password
```

## BlueSky App Passwords
A BlueSky app password is used to access the BlueSky API. These can be generated here: https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords
